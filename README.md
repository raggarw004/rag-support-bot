LLM-Powered Chatbot for Customer Support

This project demonstrates how to build a customer support chatbot powered by open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). The chatbot is designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) of a company, making it a scalable and cost-effective solution for improving customer service. Unlike simple rule-based chatbots, this system leverages advanced language models such as LLaMA 2, Falcon, or GPT4All, which provide more natural and context-aware responses.

A key feature of the chatbot is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of relying only on the base model’s knowledge, the chatbot is connected to a vector database (FAISS) that stores company-specific documents and FAQ datasets as embeddings. When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant information using semantic search and combines it with the model’s generative capabilities. This ensures that responses are accurate, up-to-date, and tailored to the company’s domain.

The project highlights several important concepts and technical skills. These include the use of vector embeddings for document representation, semantic similarity search for efficient retrieval, and prompt engineering for guiding the model toward consistent and helpful outputs. Additionally, the system includes modules for evaluation and fine-tuning so that chatbot performance can be improved over time based on real customer interactions.

The repository is structured to separate concerns: data ingestion and embedding generation, vector database integration, model inference, and chatbot interaction logic. By following this modular approach, developers can easily swap between different LLMs, experiment with embedding models, or scale the system to larger datasets.

Through this project, the skills demonstrated include working with LLMs, implementing retrieval-augmented generation, building and querying vector databases, and applying prompt engineering strategies. Together, these components form a complete end-to-end solution for creating intelligent customer support assistants powered by modern AI.
